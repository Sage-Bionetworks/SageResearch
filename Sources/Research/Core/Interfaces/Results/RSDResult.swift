/// `RSDResult` is the base implementation for a result associated with a task, step, or asynchronous action.

/// When running a task, there will be a result of some variety used to mark each step in the task. This is
/// the base protocol. All the `RSDResult` objects are required to conform to the `Encodable` protocol to allow
/// the app to store and upload results in a standardized way.
///
/// - note: syoung 04/16/2020 Since the purpose of the `Result` protocol is to support
/// serialization of the result set, and since this framework is no longer reverse-compatible to
/// ResearchKit.ORKResult objects, these objected are now defined as `PolymorphicRepresentable`
/// and `Encodable`.
