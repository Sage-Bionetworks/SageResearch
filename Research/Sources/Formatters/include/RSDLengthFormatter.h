/// Is this formatter used to describe a child's height? The default behavior for `NSLengthFormatter`
/// for locales that uses Imperial or US customary units is to show for a person's height in ft/in
/// even if the height measurement is for an infant or small child whereas, typically US height for
/// infants and children is recorded in inches only. This property, if set to `true`, will return a
/// height in inches if the locale has a US country code *and* the Locale property `usesMetricSystem` equals `false`.

/// - note: Setting this value to `true` will also set `isForPersonHeightUse` to `true`.
