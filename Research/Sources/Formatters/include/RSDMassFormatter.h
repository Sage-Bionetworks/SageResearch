/// when the locale uses Imperial or US customary units (not metric) is to show a person's weight

/// This property, if set to `true`, will return weight in lb and oz for Locales that do *not* use the
/// metric system.

/// - note: Setting this value to `true` will also set `isForPersonMassUse` to `true`.
